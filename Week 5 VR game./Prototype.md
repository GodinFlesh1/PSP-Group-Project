# Week 5
## Tasks Completed
I have created a VR player which can teleport, walk with joycons, look around using their head or the right joycon. the player can use the menu button to open up a game menu where the player can choose whether they want to use teleportation or walking with joycons
and snap turning or continuous turning. The player is also able to interact with different questions where if they get one wrong, they lose a life and if they get it correct then the question descends to the floor. If the player loses all of their lives, they are then reset to the beginning. The following link is a video showcasing the prototype: https://youtu.be/S_AZs8q6vbw
## Tasks to do
Implement a screen where the player can choose which set of questions they want to take on
