# Week 5
## Tasks Completed
I have created a VR player which can teleport, walk with joycons, look around using their head or the right joycon. the player can use the menu button to open up a game menu where the player can choose whether they want to use teleportation or walking with joycons
and snap turning or continuous turning. The following link is a video showcasing the prototype so far: https://youtu.be/z3cVHN3UH30
## Tasks to do
make it so that the player can interact with different items which prompts them with questions that we have created.
## Issues
There is a bug which sometimes occurs that causes the game to break where if the player selects a movement type too quickly it throws an error from the editor - WIP
